# FRVRIT

## Introduction
This repo contains the source code for FRVRIT (Full Room Virtual Reality Investigation Tool). FRVRIT is part of a 4th year HCI project in 2019 that was about getting new VR players comfortable with physically moving around while playing a game. Our team designed and built a roomscale game that encouraged the players to use their heads, hands, and feet (with Vive trackers) to interact. 

FRVRIT was built as a way of measuring and visualizing movement of the VR peripherals, so that we could evaluate if the game did in fact succeed in having people move around more. FRVRIT can visualize the data in a 3D space with a point cloud, voxel heatmap, or animated replay. There are multiple cameras, including an interactive one, to view the data from any angle needed.

FRVRIT was published at CHI 2019 as a Late Breaking Work submission. The paper can be found here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290607.3312825.

A video demo of FRVRIT was submitted as supplementary material and can be seen on the CHI YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNOw4ZX2ru0

## How To Run
This is a full Unity project so Unity is required to run it. Navigate into the Scenes/ folder and open the VR_Heatmap scene to begin.
